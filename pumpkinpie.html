    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <h2>Pastry for the Single-Crust Pie</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 &frac13; cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup shortening</li>

        <li>3 &frac12; tablespoons cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin, or about 1 &frac12; pounds skin-on, raw pumpkin;</li>
        <p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> You can substitute with canned pumpkin. Before you buy, you should Check
        the label to make sure of what's in the can; if it's labeled "pumpkin pie fillings" it's already spiced. If you plan to sweeten yourself with the ingredients below
        go for unflavored canned pumpkin.</p>
        <li>(12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>&frac34; cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <h2>1. Prepare Mashed Pumpkin</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Unless you're using canned pumpkin, you'll first need to prepare the mashed pumpkin. Start with 1&frac12; pounds of skin-on, raw pumpkin to yield 2 cups of mashed:</li>
        <li>Halve pumpkin and scoop out seeds and stringy portions. You can save the seeds for a roasted, crunchy snack.</li>
        <li>Cut the pumpkin into chunks.
            
        </li>
        <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, cover the pumpkin chunks with 1 inch of water and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes or tender</li>
            <li>Drain, cool and remove the peel. Return pumpkin to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. Preheat Oven</h2>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>3. Prepare Pie Crust</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons).</li>
            <li>Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together. 
            <li>Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>4. Form Pie Crust</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll dough out to about &frac18; inch thickness.</li>
            <li>With a sharp knife, cut dough 1&frac12; inch larger than the upside-down 8-to-9 inch pie pan.
                (You can use any dough scraps to make decorrative shapes using small leaf-shaped cookie cutters and place them on top of the pie filling.) 
            </li>
            <li>Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan. Form a crust by folding
                the overhanging edges under and crimp as desired.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>5. Make Pie Filling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat pumpkinwith evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the filling into your prepared crust.
                
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 40 minutes</li>
        </ul>
